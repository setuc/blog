#[My Blog](https://pipinstall.me) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ce1f6a54-8b55-4cb6-852a-579503505293/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/setuc/deploys)
This contains the markdown and the scripts for my blog. I have built it using Hugo and Netlify. Both of them make my job 
easier and help me focus on the content rather than server management. The security was of key concern to me, so decided
to go with static pages. Saves a ton of effort.
