# [My Blog](https://pipinstall.me) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ce1f6a54-8b55-4cb6-852a-579503505293/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/setuc/deploys)

This contains the markdown and the scripts for my blog. I have built it using Hugo and Netlify. Both of them make my job 
easier and help me focus on the content rather than server management. The security was of key concern to me, so decided
to go with static pages. Saves a ton of effort.  

## [Articles so far](https://pipinstall.me)
* [Introduction to Azure Personalizer](https://pipinstall.me/introduction_to_azure_personalizer/): This was off a couple of talks that i had given in the sessions in Singapore. I have the video  from the Global Azure Bootcamp 2020 (Singapore edition)
* [Getting started with Azure Machine Learning](https://pipinstall.me/getting_started_with_aml/): I have conducted quite a few sessions in here, but never managed to jot down the topic in a blog. This time I will get it done. 
* [Inside a Neural Network](https://pipinstall.me/inside_a_neural_network/): This is one the fascinating topics of mine. Some really cool ideas pursued by CSAIL (MIT), Chris Olah and Google Brain Team.
